getElementsByClassName.js

This is pretty self-explanatory, if a native method isn't present on the document
to get DOM nodes by class name (document.getElementsByClassName), my function
flatly traverses the DOM for elements with a particular class name (additionally,
it supports multiple classes on an element and a starting point).
